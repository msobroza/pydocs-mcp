# pyctx7-mcp Benchmark Suite

Compares **pyctx7-mcp** (local indexing + FTS5 search) against **Context7**
(cloud MCP API) on indexing speed, search latency, and retrieval quality.

```

## Setup

Requires Python 3.10+ and the parent `pydocs-mcp` package.

```bash
cd benchmarks
pip install -e .          # installs pydocs-mcp from parent + benchmark deps
```

## Running

```bash
# Full benchmark (includes live Context7 API calls)
run-benchmarks

# Local only — no network, faster
run-benchmarks --skip-context7

# Fewer questions for a quick smoke test
run-benchmarks --questions 10 --skip-context7

# Custom output directory
run-benchmarks --out /tmp/bench_results
```

## How the Synthetic Dataset Is Built

The dataset is built by `dataset_gen.py` via `generate_dataset(db_path, n_questions, seed)`:

1. Opens the pydocs-mcp SQLite DB (already populated by indexing the fake project + its deps)
2. Randomly samples chunks from the `chunks` table (fetches `rowid`, `pkg`, `heading`, `body`, `kind`)
3. Deduplicates by heading
4. For each sampled chunk, derives a natural-language question from the heading using one of 7 templates (e.g. `"How do I use {heading}?"`, `"What does {heading} do?"`)
5. Extracts the first sentence of the chunk body as `expected_answer_snippet`
6. Records the chunk's SQLite `rowid` as `relevant_chunk_ids` — this is the ground truth for Recall@k/MRR@k

### Dataset columns

| Column | Type | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| `question` | str | `"How do I use requests.get?"` |
| `package` | str | `"requests"` |
| `source_chunk_heading` | str | `"requests.get"` |
| `expected_answer_snippet` | str | `"Send HTTP GET request."` |
| `chunk_kind` | str | `"doc"`, `"project_code"`, `"readme"` |
| `chunk_body_preview` | str | First 200 chars of body |
| `relevant_chunk_ids` | list[int] | `[42]` — rowid(s) used as ground truth |

The `relevant_chunk_ids` column is key — it's what allows `search_bench.py` to compute proper Recall@k and MRR@k by matching search result rowids against these ground-truth IDs.

### Pipeline flow

```
fake project generated → indexed into SQLite → generate_dataset() samples chunks →
dataset fed to run_search_benchmark() (pyctx7) and run_context7_benchmark() (Context7) →
results flattened via to_dataframe() → saved as benchmark_results.csv
```

## Metrics

**Recall@k** — proportion of ground-truth relevant chunks found in the top-k results.

**MRR@k** (Mean Reciprocal Rank) — inverse of the rank position of the first relevant result in top-k (0 if no relevant result found). Averaged across all queries.

Both metrics are evaluated for k ∈ [1, 3, 5, 10, 20].

For pyctx7-mcp, ground truth is the source chunk from which each question was derived (`relevant_chunk_ids` in the dataset). For Context7, relevance is approximated by checking if the expected answer snippet appears in the returned documentation text.

## Context7 API

Context7 is accessed at `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp` using the
`resolve-library-id` and `get-library-docs` MCP tools. No API key required.
Network latency will dominate Context7 timings — run from a stable connection.
